The primal problem with the Internet of Things is the lack
of interoperability at various levels, and more predominately
at the device level. While there exists multitude of plat-
forms from multiple manufacturers, the existing ecosystem
still remains highly closed. In this work, we propose SNaaS
or Sensor/Network as a Service: a service layer that en-
ables the creation of the plug-n-play infrastructure, across
platforms from multiple vendors, necessary for interoper-
ability and successful deployment of large-scale systems. We
present the design (can be found in docs/TEDS.pdf) and implementation of SNaaS (apps/android), implementation of webapplication (Form Designer and Creator), TEDS encoder and decoder in (src/).
